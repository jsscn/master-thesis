\chapter{Conclusion}

sequential pattern mining

episodes (graph with labelled nodes)

serial, parallel

association rules from frequent episodes

different frequency measures, recap their properties, advantages and disadvantages

recap algorithms; different algorithms for both episode classes

experiments

efficiency: episodes (classes, frequency measures, window widths), association rules

output quality: better with closed and stuff
