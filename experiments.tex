\chapter{Experiments}

We compare the efficiency of the implementation with a closed episode miner\footnote{http://adrem.ua.ac.be/mining-closed-strict-episodes}, which has options to include episodes which are not closed.

We'll do a comparative study with two implementations of mining algorithms that use different, non-frequency interestingness measures.

The first interestingness measure is called \emph{cohesion}. The cohesiveness of an episode/itemset expresses how closely the events of its occurrences are to each other, that is, the distance between events is taken into account.
